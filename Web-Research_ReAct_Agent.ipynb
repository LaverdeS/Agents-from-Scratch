    "### Implementation Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLM Reasoning Process\n",
    "The LLM uses ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern for structured decision-making:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thought**: LLM generates reasoning about what needs to be done next.\n",
    "- **Action**: LLM decides which tool to call with specific arguments.\n",
    "- **Observation**: System provides tool execution results back to LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning works by prompting the LLM to output structured XML tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<thought> - Internal reasoning step\n",
    "<tool_call> - JSON-formatted tool invocation\n",
    "<response> - Final answer when research is complete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the research agent specifically, the LLM follows a 3-phase approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning**: Generate 5-6 research questions about the topic.\n",
    "- **Acting**: Systematically search web for each question using tavily_web_search.\n",
    "- **Compilation (Report Generation)**: Aggregate findings into structured markdown report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Flow and Architecture\n",
    "###### Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReactAgent** Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Manages OpenAI client, tools, and system prompt (`RESEARCH_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).\n",
    "- - Orchestrates the ReAct loop for up to max_rounds iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization: User message + system prompt with tool signatures sent to LLM\n",
    "ReAct Loop (max 10 rounds):\n",
    "- - LLM generates completion with <thought> and <tool_call> tags\n",
    "- - If <response> tag found → return final answer\n",
    "- - Extract tool calls → validate arguments → execute tools\n",
    "<!-- - - Add observations to chat history → continue loop -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fallback: Return raw LLM completion if no structured response\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Research Agent Workflow\n",
    "For research tasks, the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** **Generates** research questions about the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** **Searches** the web iteratively for each research question using Tavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** **Compiles** all search results into comprehensive markdown report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns final report in <response> tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system maintains chat history throughout the process, allowing the LLM to build context across multiple tool calls and reasoning steps."

       "\"# Spiral Dynamics: A Comprehensive Report\\n\\n## Introduction\\nSpiral Dynamics, a powerful and adaptive psychological model, offers insights into human development by delineating various states of consciousness and behavioral patterns. Emerging from the foundational work of Clare Graves and developed further by Don Beck and Chris Cowan, this model maps human progress, both individually and collectively, across a spectrum of consistent, colored stages.\\n\\n## What is the Origin and Theoretical Basis of Spiral Dynamics?\\nSpiral Dynamics was initially developed from Clare W. Graves's emergent cyclical levels of existence theory. Graves proposed a framework in which human evolution and psychosocial development emerge cyclically in response to environmental challenges. This bio-psycho-social model was later popularized by Don Beck and Chris Cowan as Spiral Dynamics. The theory has evolved into several derivatives, including Spiral Dynamics Integral (SDi), which integrates the ideas with Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, emphasizing spirituality and higher consciousness.\\n\\n## How has Spiral Dynamics Evolved Over Time?\\nSpiral Dynamics has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Initially derived from Graves's original hypothesis, the theory was expanded by Beck and Cowan into a consultant framework for addressing psychosocial and organizational issues. Over time, the model has been split into various interpretations: Beck's SDi and Cowan's SPIRAL DYNAMICS® each offering distinct applications in leadership and cultural development alongside a trademark and community-centric approach. The model continues to adapt, accommodating new research and applications.\\n\\n## What are the Main Stages or Levels in Spiral Dynamics and What Do They Represent?\\nSpiral Dynamics consists of a series of colored levels or vMEMEs, each representing a distinct worldview:\\n- **Beige**: Survivalistic instincts and necessities.\\n- **Purple**: Tribal and magical thinking, emphasizing safety and family.\\n- **Red**: Egocentric power and assertiveness.\\n- **Blue**: Authoritarian structures providing purpose and meaning.\\n- **Orange**: Achievements and success in competitive environments.\\n- **Green**: Sensitivity and community-focused perspectives.\\n- **Yellow**: Systemic and integrative understanding.\\n- **Turquoise**: Holistic and global consciousness.\\nPotential future levels (Coral and beyond) are speculated but not fully detailed in current literature.\\n\\n## How is Spiral Dynamics Applied in Organizational and Personal Growth Contexts?\\nOrganizations leverage Spiral Dynamics to navigate leadership structures, conflict resolutions, and cultural transformations. The model assists leaders in understanding different values and motivation systems within teams. In personal growth, individuals use it to better comprehend personal development paths, offering a structured path for self-awareness and emotional mastery. Spiral Dynamics has been notably used to break down cultural barriers, such as during South Africa's post-Apartheid era.\\n\\n## What are Some Critiques and Controversies Surrounding Spiral Dynamics?\\nCritics of Spiral Dynamics argue that it oversimplifies complex human behaviors by categorizing them into discrete stages. There are claims that it may have cultural biases, perhaps overly generalizing human nature. Some psychological critiques equate it with pseudoscience due to a lack of rigorous empirical validation. Additionally, the model is sometimes challenged for underestimating the fluid and dynamic aspects of human consciousness.\\n\\n## How Does Spiral Dynamics Integrate with Other Psychological Theories?\\nSpiral Dynamics seamlessly integrates with other theories, specifically Ken Wilber's Integral Theory. It contributes an understanding of value systems and stages to the broader integral framework, which accounts for individual and collective human experiences. Integral Theory uses a multi-dimensional approach to encompass many existing psychological models while enhancing the systemic understanding provided by Spiral Dynamics.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nSpiral Dynamics offers a strategic lens through which to observe human development, providing a robust framework for understanding complex psychological, cultural, and leadership dynamics. Despite facing criticism, its integration into various fields showcases its remarkable adaptability and enduring relevance in both personal and organizational contexts.\""
